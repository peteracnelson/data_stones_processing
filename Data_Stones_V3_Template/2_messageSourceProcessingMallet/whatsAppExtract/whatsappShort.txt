8/18/17, 12:16 PM - Bogna M Konior: So, at the hospital they tell me I should call a number to find out about the details and price. No or at reception knows. Doctor determines price of treatment. Initial consultation is 700-2200, no one at reception was able to tell me how this is determined. Follow up consultation is around 1500, does not include price of actual treatment. Basic physio is 550 per meeting, if electric stimulatation address is plus 300, biofeedback she doesn't know but also couple of hundred. Injections are in the thousands. All in all, seems even more expensive than going to to physio privately, but it's more comprehensive pain treatment, but every thing you add on, you have to pay. I don't know why I came here cause I know all this, I that the situation is impossible. :(
 ¬†¬†8/18/17, 12:19 PM - Bogna M Konior: I mean, in general the situation is the same it was back in 2015, I am not really finding out anything new... And yet still every month I go to a different place or a different doctor to find out the same thing...
8/18/17, 12:20 PM - Bogna M Konior: I was not able to find out if there is anyone with experience treating my stuff, she didn't know. She said to call the number. I told her that I did and was unsuccessful. But she read like, well i wouldn't know. It's the doctor who sends you to specialists, not us on registration.
8/18/17, 12:23 PM - Bogna M Konior: So I left. I don't know if I should have done something else, I'm just burnt out and don't have the strength. I don't know why I keep telling myself I can change anything about the Hong Kong situation. There is nothing to be done
8/18/17, 12:23 PM - peteracnelson: sounds like a crazy run around. You have solid diagnostic advice from your doctor in Poland, from Peggy and from Doug, all recommending specific treatments, which you want to pay for, rather than paying for the same consult and diagnosis again and again.  would you mind if I put you in touch with my friend Joseph who is the paediatrician in Hong Kong? If simply only to see if this bureaucrazy can be short-circuited?
8/18/17, 12:23 PM - Bogna M Konior: I just can't do it anymore baby.
8/18/17, 12:23 PM - Bogna M Konior: It's too much for me. I give up.
8/18/17, 12:24 PM - Bogna M Konior: I can't keep going through the same thing every year, every month. I can't keep seeing new people and hoping that this time it will be different.
8/18/17, 12:24 PM - Bogna M Konior: It is just always the same. I guess it's not gonna happen for me.
8/18/17, 12:26 PM - peteracnelson: agree. you don't need to start from scratch again and again. would you mind if I ask Joseph whether he can see a way around the unnecessary double consults?
8/18/17, 12:26 PM - Bogna M Konior: The way is to pay for private pain managment I guess.
8/18/17, 12:27 PM - Bogna M Konior: But it's very difficult to find people here for some reason who do that. My theory is that I'm in purgatory cause otherwise it makes no sense.
8/18/17, 12:27 PM - Bogna M Konior: But even with pim if she was still here, I have to pay for first consult. And she would only be pt and physio, not other stuff, whatever might be needed.
8/18/17, 12:29 PM - Bogna M Konior: I'm still in the process of finding out about people pim recommends but that would be pt and biofeedback, prices would also be like 1000 per meeting and I don't know if this includes bfeedback or just basic pt
8/18/17, 12:29 PM - Bogna M Konior: I guess I don't know, I just keep doing the excercises on my own and hope they start helping after a few months
8/18/17, 12:31 PM - Bogna M Konior: I only follow the biofeedback advice cause Doug recommended it, but what if this alone does not help, just like dry needling did not help, just like Lyrica did not help... He says this is the golden standard of treatment for at least one of the things I have, that's why I'm looking at it now. But I do have no one in Hong Kong who could oversee my case apart from isolated treatment
8/18/17, 12:31 PM - Bogna M Konior: In other words, I do the same thing over and over and over again and never making even a bit of progress, even tho I put to much effort. I don't know why I am still doing it
8/18/17, 12:32 PM - Bogna M Konior: I ask myself this question my whole life. The more they tell me it's treatable, the more depressing, ridiculous and cruel the last ten years of my life seem to be. Like it can't be real. But it is.
8/18/17, 12:33 PM - peteracnelson: fingers crossed for Pim coming up with the goods
8/18/17, 12:34 PM - Bogna M Konior: Always fingers crossed for something... What's the point...
8/18/17, 12:34 PM - peteracnelson: back when i had dinner with Joseph he offered any help with getting through bureaucracy of HK doctors. let me know if you want me to try that option at any point
8/18/17, 12:35 PM - Bogna M Konior: Every attempt is just adding to the cruelty of the whole thing..
8/19/17, 1:25 PM - peteracnelson: Where r ?

8/22/17, 9:10 PM - Bogna M Konior: Hey I got home an hour ago, early today, printed out work to reduce screen time, so I'm safe if that's what you're worrying about :)

8/22/17, 9:11 PM - Bogna M Konior: I've seen the typhoon warnings in the city today, but not of great force. But seems it'll be rainy and windy and unpleasant outside

8/22/17, 10:44 PM - Bogna M Konior: I think they might only have the vanilla version which is fine. It's closer to the cashier of the two dairy shelves, in the middle
